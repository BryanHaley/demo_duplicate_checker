# Demo Duplicate Checker

How to use:

1. Download from [releases](https://github.com/BryanHaley/demo_duplicate_checker/releases).
2. Obtain credentials.json from leaderboard mods and place it next to .exe.
3. Open .exe or drag a .dem file onto .exe.
  - Note: On first run you will have to log into a google account and google will give you a scary warning. You may use a throw-away google account if you wish. Go to advanced -> proceed anyway.
4. Enter runner name, run category, and path to demo files.
5. Observe if there are conflicts (potential duplicate submission) or no conflicts (all clear).
